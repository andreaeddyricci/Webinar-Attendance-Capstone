# Webinar-Attendance-Capstone
A project for 3DHeals, a collector of innovators and early adopters in healthcare 3D printing, bioprinting, and related technologies

## Problem Identification
**The Question**: What can be developed that informs 3DHeals who is joining their webinars, how they can increase the number of participants, and how they can increase engagement during the webinars?

**The Audience**: The results will be presented to the CEO and founder of 3DHeals Jenny Chen.

**The Data**: The data is from Zoom of four different webinars (Indian Ecosystem, Post-processing, Biomaterials, and 3D Metal) put on by 3DHeals in 2019.

**The Time Frame**: February 2023-April 2023

**The Modeling Response**: the percentage (between 0 and 1) of time a participant will spend in a webinar

**The Model**: Supervised regression using Gradient Boosting with RSME = 24%

**The Deliverables**: Colab notebooks of data wrangling through modeling, as well as this final report and presentation

**The Team**: Andrea Ricci & Diana Golman
